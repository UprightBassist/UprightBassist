- 👋 Hi, I’m @UprightBassist
- 👀 I’m interested in music, people, languages, nature, science, applications, ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning hotel management.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Jazz, Funk, Soul, Reggae, and any software thaat I use (which are many), so I might find some enhancement possibilities and even bugs.
- 📫 How to reach me? Don't, I reach you!
- 😄 Pronouns: are replacing a noun, AFAIK. I'm not a noun, and I wouldn't like to be replaced, so keep them to yourself.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I actually know how to play upright basses very well, upright pianos almost, and try to be as upright as possible myself.
